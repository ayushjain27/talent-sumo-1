      <p className={styles.para}>
        <span className={styles.points}>Likeability:</span> All of us have heard
        and likely commented, “I like that guy/gal!” The science of likeability
        says that the smile is the biggest key ingredient of liking an
        individual. Researchers say ability to smile and remain stress free are
        key markers of a successful interview. How much and how frequently you
        smile gives out subtle indication that you are in control of the
        conversation. This should not be confused with laughter. Our algorithms
        generate proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of Likeability
        in four cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate’s likeability.
        So how can you be more likeable? Simple, practice delivering the answers
        with smiles as if you are talking to a friend. The top cohort rating (A)
        on more that 75% of the questions denotes high degree of proficiency in
        this soft skill that should be aimed.

      <p className={styles.para}>
        <span className={styles.points}>Charm:</span> How doesn’t want to be
        charming? Did you know that certain body language markers like eye
        movement and gazes’ signals how charming you appear or otherwise? Human
        resource experts and researchers have discovered that some of these
        markers can indeed charm the interviewer in your favor in a subconscious
        way. Our algorithms generate proprietary scores that divides this soft
        skill of Charm in four cohorts as a relative barometer of the
        candidate’s charm. This should not be confused with excessive
        expressions. So how can you improve your scores? Simple, practice
        delivering the answers looking directly at the camera with steady gaze
        without getting distracted by other elements. The top cohort rating (A)
        on more than 75% of the questions denotes high degree of proficiency in
        this soft skill that should be aimed.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.para}>
        <span className={styles.points}>Confidence:</span>Do you use a lot of
        filler words like “actually”, “really”, “like” and others? Many of us
        have the habit of doing so in our subconscious mind. This creates a
        negative impression in the minds of the interviews as if the candidate.
        Researchers have discovered that we often associate the table of
        “low-confidence” with such candidates. Our algorithms generate
        proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of Confidence in four
        cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate’s confidence. This
        should not be confused with word play. So how can you improve your
        scores? Simple, think and answer confidently without any filler words.
        The top cohort rating on more that 75% of the questions denotes high
        degree of proficiency in this soft skill that should be aimed.

      <p className={styles.para}>
        <span className={styles.points}>Energy:</span> Ever heard a comment “Wow
        he was super high energy!” The strength of our voice, voice modulation
        and pitch matters. In makes difficult ideas easy to understand and
        signals to the interviewer that the candidates know his “stuff”. Our
        algorithms generate proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of
        energy into four cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate’s
        energy. This should not be confused with merely loud voice. So how can
        you improve your scores? Simple, practice delivering the answers with
        good voice modulation and pitch range along with a normal voice. The top
        cohort rating (A) on more that 75% of the questions denotes high degree
        of proficiency in this soft skill, that should be aimed.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.para}>
        <span className={styles.points}>Fluency:</span> We all want to sound
        fluent in the interviews but whether due to the pressure or tension, we
        tend to fumble with words and take long awkward pauses. This is exactly
        opposite to a rockstar candidate who always appear to be fluent. Our
        algorithms generate proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of
        fluency into four cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate’s
        fluency. This should not be confused with merely rapid speech. So how
        can you improve your scores? Simple, practice delivering the answers
        with which are well thought out. Request for a minute to formulate your
        answers before you start speaking so that unnecessary pauses can be
        avoided. The top cohort rating (A) on more that 75% of the questions
        denotes high degree of proficiency in this soft skill, that should be
        aimed.

        <span className={styles.points}>Content Ratings:</span> We evaluate the
        content of the responses not only by the best possible answer to that
        question but using our context cloud we are further enhancing the
        accuracy of what of answers might be relevant to what kind of situation.
        Any candidate taking time to understand and align to the context in
        which he is operating and using industry specific terminologies to
        articulate his point of view is likely to do well in the content
        ratings. The top cohort rating (A) on more than 75% of the questions
        denotes high degree of proficiency and accuracy in his answers.
